# EncryptionProject
Final project for the class of Comp123. Encrypts and decrypts files using three different encryption methods. Uses a tkinter interface

Encrypt: Encrypts any text file according to the specified encryption method: Caesar, Vigenere, Random and Custom. 
Random creates a random key for each one of the letters in the file. 
Custom allows the user to choose the key for each one of the letters.

Decrypt: Decrypts the selected text file provided that it was previously encrypted using Cipher.
